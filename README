How to use django-petitions
------------------------------

``django-petitions`` allows for basic petitions functionality in your django project.

### Install

For now, to install django-petitions, check it out from github using:

        git clone git://github.com/rmanocha/django-petitions.git

You can then copy either copy the petitions folder to your python distribution's
``site-packages`` folder or create a symbolic link.

### Adding ``django-petitions`` to your project

You will need to add the petitions app to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting in 
your settings.py file. It should look something like::

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'petitions',
        )

You will also need to add the petitions urls to your site's URLConf. You can 
do this by adding the following line to your URLConf::

        (r'petitions/', include('petitions.urls')),

That's it. You can now create petitions by going to ``/petitions/add/`` and 
view a complete list of create petitions at ``/petitions/``.
